# Security Policy

## Supported Scope

This repository is pre-1.0 and currently publishes security-profile drafts,
tests, vectors, and implementation helpers. Security reports should target the
current `main` branch and any tagged release that remains publicly referenced.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report suspected vulnerabilities through GitHub private vulnerability reporting
for this repository. Do not open a public issue with exploit details, tokens,
keys, private logs, or working proof-of-concept material.

Please include:

- affected file, package, profile section, or test vector;
- expected security boundary;
- observed bypass, crash, downgrade, replay, or disclosure behavior;
- minimal reproduction steps when they can be shared safely;
- whether the issue affects profile text, implementation code, CI tests, or
  inherited Cocos runtime code.

The maintainer will triage whether the report is a profile issue, an
implementation issue, inherited runtime debt, or out of scope for this
repository.
